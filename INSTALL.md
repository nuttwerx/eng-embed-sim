# Installation

1. Be on Windows

    The simulator should work on Mac and probably linux, but the FCU is a compiled DLL and will only work on Windows (tested on 8.1, 10.x should also be fine). I've had good success with parallels and Windows 8.1. You wil also need Visual Studio's C++ toolset (VC++ 2017 v141 toolset (x86,x64)) - Visual Studio 2017's [community edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) with the aforementioned toolset should work (you might be able to also get the toolset without Visual Studio).

2. Make a directory and check out the following repositories as siblings: 
    
    ```
    mkdir rloopsim
    cd rloopsim
    git clone https://github.com/rLoopTeam/eng-embed-sim.git
    git clone https://github.com/rLoopTeam/eng-software-pod.git
    git clone https://github.com/rLoopTeam/react-groundstation.git
    ```

3. Install Python 2.7 (32 bit version). __You must use 32-bit Python or the FCU DLL will not work.__ I'm using Python 2.7.13, but other versions will likely work just fine. 

    ```
    https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13.msi
    ```

    By default, this will install to C:\Python27\ -- if you change the install location, make sure to change 
    the appropriate arguments when setting up your virtualenv as well (see below).

4. Install virtualenv
    
    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

5. Create your virtualenv under your rloopsim directory (we're still in the same directory as step 2). 
    
    ```
    virtualenv --prompt="(rloopsim)" --no-site-packages --python=C:\Python27\python.exe env
    ```

6. Activate the virtualenv
__Remember: You will need to do this at the start of any session working with the simulator.__ See the above link or http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/ for more details.

    Note: you will likely need to relax restrictions on running scripts for this to work. 
    - From powershell, use the following to run a new shell as administrator: 'Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs'
    - From the administrator powershell, run the following: 'Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned'

    Now you can activate your virtualenv like so: 

    ```
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

7. Use pip to install the simulator in development mode

    ```
    cd eng-embed-sim
    pip install -e .
    ```

8. Run the simulator (from the top level of eng-embed-sim)

    ```
    python rloopsim/sim.py conf/sim_config.py
    ```

(todo: fill in mor documentation)
